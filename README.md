# Enhancing-Queue-Efficiency-via-Lane-Capacity-Planning-and-Tray-Processing-Rates-at-Airports
The project focuses on optimizing queue performance at regulated airports through effective lane capacity planning and tray processing rates. The case study used in this project is an imaginary Airport.

**Scenario:**

For every 15 minutes an average queue over 5 minutes results in a "hit". The maximum hits per day is 4 and the maximum hits per month is 120. In order to efficiently manage the queue, the airport uses lanes to minimize the queues. These lanes are dependant on the number of Trays per hour (TPH) per lane. The higher the TPH per lane the lesser the total number of lanes opened.

**Problem:**

Determining the optimum TPH to meet the target of 4 daily hits.

The purpose of this project is to explore how the optimization of lane capacity planning and tray processing rates can help to achieve the queue performance target of 5 minutes at regulated airports.
